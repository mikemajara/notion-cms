/**
 * Public API Contract (M1)
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Freeze the public export surface of the package to avoid accidental breaking changes.
 * - Provide a readable snapshot that users and contributors can consult.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This is a scaffold. Real assertions will be added after fixtures and final API review.
